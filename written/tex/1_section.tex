Example on how to include graphics and tables, located in the python project.

For the graphics I created a link to the variance-python/results/graphics file in ``mystyle.tex'' hence only the name of the graphic without .png ending has to be specified.

\includegraphics{example_graphic}

For tables the whole path has to be specified

\input{../variance-python/results/tables/example_table.tex}
