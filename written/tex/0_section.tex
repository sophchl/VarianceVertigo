\section{Introduction}\label{sec:chapter0}

The purpose of our project is to replicate and extend the analysis of the 'Downside Variance Risk Premium' study by \textit{ B. Fenou, M.R. Jahan-Parvar and C. Okou [2015]}. To this end, more recent data has been added and various methodologies have been implemented. 

The rest of the project is structured as follows. In Section 2 we present an overview of 'Downside Variance Risk Premium' \textit{[Fenou 2015]}. In Section 3 we present our construction methods for the various measures. In particular, we present the decomposition of the VRP and the construction of risk-neutral and realized semi-variances. Section 4 entails the data used in the analysis and the respective cleaning procedures. The main findings are presented in Section 5. In Section 6, we discuss the results and finally, Section 7 concludes.
