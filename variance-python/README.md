# VarianceVertigo - variance-python
Our python project

Code
all functions will be copied in here, if possible use lowercase letters, no spacing
all functions come together in the main.py file

an example module (.py document) is included called "example.py".
It involves loading a module, executing a function written in that module, saving a graphic and a table. 

Data
The data is stored in the data file. As the data is large, the raw file is ignored by git.

Results
please store graphics and tables here. latex can access those files
