abstract ={The paper proposes an additive cascade model of volatility components defined over different time periods. This volatility cascade leads to a simple AR-type model in the realized volatility with the feature of considering different volatility components realized over different time horizons and thus termed Heterogeneous Autoregressive model of Realized Volatility (HAR-RV). In spite of the simplicity of its structure and the absence of true long-memory properties, simulation results show that the HAR-RV model successfully achieves the purpose of reproducing the main empirical features of financial returns (long memory, fat tails, and self-similarity) in a very tractable and parsimonious way. Moreover, empirical results show remarkably good forecasting performance.},

We show that the risk-neutral expected value of return variance, also known as the variance swap rate, is well approximated by the value of a particular portfolio of options. We propose to use the difference between the realized variance and this synthetic variance swap rate to quantify the variance risk premium. Using a large options data set, we synthesize variance swap rates and investigate the historical behavior of variance risk premiums on five stock indexes and 35 individual stocks.},

abstract ={We investigate whether the volatility risk premium is negative by examining the statistical properties of delta-hedged option portfolios (buy the option and hedge with stock). Within a stochastic volatility framework, we demonstrate a correspondence between the sign and magnitude of the volatility risk premium and the mean delta-hedged portfolio returns. Using a sample of S&P 500 index options, we provide empirical tests that have the following general results. First, the delta-hedged strategy underperforms zero. Second, the documented underperformance is less for options away from the money. Third, the underperformance is greater at times of higher volatility. Fourth, the volatility risk premium significantly affects delta-hedged gains, even after accounting for jump fears. Our evidence is supportive of a negative market volatility risk premium.},

abstract ={This article shows that realized power variation and its extension, realized bipower variation, which we introduce here, are somewhat robust to rare jumps. We demonstrate that in special cases, realized bipower variation estimates integrated variance in stochastic volatility models, thus providing a model-free and consistent alternative to realized variance. Its robustness property means that if we have a stochastic volatility plus infrequent jumps process, then the difference between realized variance and realized bipower variation estimates the quadratic variation of the jump component. This seems to be the first method that can separate quadratic variation into its continuous and jump components. Various extensions are given, together with proofs of special cases of these results. Detailed mathematical results are reported in Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2003a).},
